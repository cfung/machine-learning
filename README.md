# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Projects

Project 0:  Titanic Survival Exploration -  create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age.

Project 1:  Predicting Boston Housing Prices - build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home.

Project 2:  Building a Student Intervention System - to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam.

Project 3: Creating Customer Segments - use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

Project 4: Train a Smartcab to Drive - use reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a smartcab operating in real-time to prove that both safety and efficiency can be achieved.
